# MDX Editor Implementation

This document outlines the process of implementing the MDX Editor in our blog system.

## Overview

We've replaced the basic textarea-based markdown editor with a more feature-rich MDX Editor. The new implementation provides a better writing experience with a toolbar, real-time preview, and enhanced markdown support.

## Implementation Steps

1. **Installation**

   ```bash
   pnpm add @mdxeditor/editor
   ```

2. **Component Structure**

   - Created a new `MDXEditorComponent` in `components/mdx-editor.tsx`
   - Updated `BlogPostEditor` to use the new MDX editor
   - Maintained the existing preview functionality

3. **Features Implemented**

   - Rich text editing toolbar
   - Markdown shortcuts
   - Headings support
   - Lists (ordered and unordered)
   - Blockquotes
   - Code blocks
   - Tables
   - Links
   - Thematic breaks
   - Undo/Redo functionality

4. **Integration Points**
   - The editor maintains compatibility with existing markdown rendering
   - Preserves the tab-based write/preview interface
   - Maintains dark/light theme support

## Usage

The MDX Editor can be used in any component by importing the `MDXEditorComponent`:

```tsx
import { MDXEditorComponent } from "@/components/mdx-editor";

// In your component:
<MDXEditorComponent
  value={markdownContent}
  onChange={(newValue) => setMarkdownContent(newValue)}
/>;
```

## Styling

The editor comes with its own styles, but we've added some custom styling to match our application's theme:

- Border and rounded corners
- Dark mode support
- Consistent spacing and layout

## Future Improvements

Potential areas for enhancement:

1. Add image upload support
2. Implement custom markdown shortcuts
3. Add more toolbar options
4. Improve mobile responsiveness
5. Add custom plugins for specific markdown features

## Dependencies

- @mdxeditor/editor: ^3.32.3
- React: ^19.1.0
- Next.js: Latest version

## Notes

- The editor is client-side only (marked with "use client")
- Maintains compatibility with existing markdown content
- Preserves the existing preview functionality
